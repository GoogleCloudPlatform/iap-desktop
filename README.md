## Access Linux and Windows VMs from anywhere

</a>

IAP Desktop uses [Identity-Aware-Proxy (IAP)](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/tcp-forwarding-overview) to connect to VM instances so that you can:

*   Connect to VM instances that donâ€™t have a public IP address
*   Connect from anywhere over the internet

Together, IAP Desktop and [Identity-Aware-Proxy (IAP)](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/tcp-forwarding-overview) let you apply zero-trust security to your VMs:

*   Apply fine-grained access controls that define [who can access which VM](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/using-tcp-forwarding#configuring_access_and_permissions)
*   Use [access levels](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/cloud-iap-context-aware-access-howto) to restrict access by time or location
*   Use [BeycondCorp Enterprise](https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp-enterprise) to limit access to trusted devices

The application automatically manages IAP TCP tunnels for you, and protects them so that no other users or programs can access them.

IAP Desktop [includes an SSH client and terminal](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/iap-desktop/wiki/Connecting-to-linux-instances) so that you can:

*   Use multiple SSH sessions in parallel, and switch between them using tabs
*   Upload and download files using SFTP

To help you authenticate to Linux VMs, IAP Desktop can:

*   Automatically create and publish SSH keys to [OS Login](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/oslogin) or [metadata](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/connect/add-ssh-keys#metadata)
*   Use OS Login [2-factor authentication](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/oslogin/set-up-oslogin)
*   Store our SSH keys locally using Windows CNG
